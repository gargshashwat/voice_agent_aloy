# Voice AI Agent Prototype - Learning Project

## Primary Goal
**Learn to build prototypes quickly** by building a voice AI advisor for the GreatInventions project.

This is a LEARNING PROJECT - the focus is on understanding architecture, making rapid decisions, and building end-to-end systems, not just shipping a product.

## Project Context

### GreatInventions Background

### Voice Agent Purpose
A conversational AI advisor that helps with:
- Choosing next topics to write about
- Marketing strategies
- Brainstorming ideas for the project
- General project advice

## Agent Specifications

### Personality - "Aloy"
- **Name:** Aloy (inspired by Horizon Zero Dawn character)
- **Role:** Brainstorming partner
- **Tone:** Energetic, conversational, fast-paced, strong and curious
- **Response style:** Brief (2-3 sentences max), asks 1-2 clarifying questions max, offers crisp actionable suggestions
- **Language:** Uses "we" language, occasionally challenges assumptions, proactively suggests ideas
- **Voice:** Female voice matching Aloy's character - strong, determined, curious (ElevenLabs)

### Technical Requirements
- Real-time back-and-forth conversation
- Low latency (feels like talking to a real person)
- Spacebar push-to-talk interaction
- Visual UI showing agent state with automatic transitions
- Full GreatInventions context (PROJECT_GOALS, published articles, writing style)
- Conversation memory across sessions (summary-based)

## Architecture

### High-Level Flow
```
User Voice → STT → Claude API → TTS → Audio Output
              ↓                    ↓
         Transcript          Audio Chunks
              ↓                    ↓
         Conversation         UI Feedback
           History          (listening/speaking)
```

### Component Stack

**1. Speech-to-Text (STT)**
- **Choice:** Deepgram (~$0.0043/min)
- Why: Fast, cheap, good quality, supports streaming
- Alternative: OpenAI Whisper for higher accuracy

**2. Conversation Engine**
- **Choice:** Claude API (Sonnet 4.5)
- Streaming enabled for low latency
- System prompt: Defines advisor persona + GreatInventions context
- Conversation history: Last 10-15 exchanges

**3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- **Choice:** ElevenLabs (~$0.30/1K chars)
- Female voice (user-selected)
- Streaming enabled

**4. Desktop Application**
- **Choice:** Electron + Node.js
- Frontend: Simple HTML/CSS/JS or React
- Backend: WebSocket server orchestrating all services

### Latency Optimization Strategy

**Goal:** <2 second response time from user finishing speech to agent starting to speak

**Techniques:**
1. **Streaming everywhere:**
   - Deepgram: Real-time transcription via WebSocket
   - Claude: Stream tokens as generated
   - ElevenLabs: Stream audio chunks

2. **Sentence-level chunking:**
   - Don't wait for full Claude response
   - Send each complete sentence to TTS immediately
   - Play audio as soon as first chunk arrives

3. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):**
   - Detect when user stops speaking
   - Start processing immediately
   - Support interruptions (stop playback if user speaks)

4. **Parallel processing:**
   - While sentence N is being spoken, sentence N+1 is being generated

### UI Design

**Visual Reference:** J&J screenshots - Siri-like spirit orb design

**Interface:**
- **Spirit orb:** Central radial gradient sphere with soft blur
- **State tag:** Pill-shaped label below orb showing current state
- **Color-coded states (automatic transitions):**
  - **Blue:** Idle/waiting for input (gentle pulse)
  - **Green:** Listening (press spacebar, amplitude-reactive animation)
  - **Purple:** Thinking/processing (rotation/flow effect)
  - **Orange/Yellow:** Speaking (waveform synced to audio)

**Interaction Flow:**
1. Press spacebar → Green (Listening)
2. Release spacebar → Purple (Thinking)
3. Aloy starts speaking → Orange (Speaking)
4. Response complete → Blue (Idle)

**Optional for debugging:**
- Live transcript display
- Latency metrics

### Memory System

**Conversation Summaries:**
After each conversation, Claude generates a summary containing:
- Date and time
- Topics discussed
- Ideas generated
- Decisions made
- Action items/next steps
- User's interests and priorities

**Storage:**
- Simple JSON file: `conversations/memory.json`
- Human-readable and editable
- Lightweight (summaries, not full transcripts)

**Context Loading:**
- On app startup, load last 10 conversation summaries
- Include in system prompt as "Previous conversations context"
- Enables continuity across sessions
- Keeps token usage low while maintaining memory

**Benefits:**
- Cost-effective (summaries vs full transcripts)
- Debuggable (can read/edit JSON directly)
- Scalable (can add search/export features later)
- Natural conversations ("Remember last time we discussed...")

### Budget Constraints

**Target:** <$10 for all iteration/testing

**Estimated costs per hour of conversation:**
- STT (Deepgram): $0.26
- Claude API: $0.45
- ElevenLabs: $0.90
- **Total: ~$1.60/hour** → ~6 hours of testing with $10

## Tech Stack

**Application:**
- Electron (desktop app framework)
- Node.js (backend/orchestration)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (TBD based on learning preference)

**Frontend:**
- HTML/CSS for UI
- Web Audio API for mic input/speaker output
- Canvas or CSS animations for visualizations

**Backend Services:**
- Deepgram Node SDK

- Better perceived latency and engagement

**Next Session:** Iteration 3 - Memory System (conversation summaries across sessions), or Iteration 4 - Voice Output (TTS)

---

### Session 3 (Continued) - 2025-12-25

**Completed: Iteration 3 - Memory System (100%)**

✅ **Achievements:**
- Built complete memory service with conversation summaries
- Implemented reliable save-on-close using raw messages (no async issues)
- Auto-converts raw messages to summaries on app startup
- Memory context loaded and included in system prompt
- "Clear Memory" button with confirmation dialog
- Dual-format storage: raw (instant save) → summary (background processing)
- No data loss even with < 6 messages

📚 **Learning Topics:**
- File system operations in Node.js (fs.readFileSync, fs.writeFileSync)
- JSON storage patterns for small data
- Async timing issues with window.beforeunload
- Background processing on app startup
- Synchronous vs asynchronous save strategies
- Type-based data structures (raw vs summary)

🎯 **What Works:**
- Conversations saved automatically every 6 messages
- Raw messages saved instantly on app close (reliable!)
- Raw messages converted to summaries on next startup
- Aloy remembers previous conversations across sessions
- Clear Memory button resets everything
- Memory file is human-readable and editable JSON

🔧 **Technical Solution:**
- Problem: beforeunload with async API calls was unreliable
- Solution: Save raw messages (synchronous), summarize later
- Format: `{type: "raw", messages: [...]}` → `{type: "summary", summary: "..."}`
- Memory loads last 10 summaries into system prompt

**Next Session:** Iteration 4 - Voice Output (TTS with ElevenLabs), or Iteration 5 - Voice Input (STT with Deepgram)

---

### Session 4 - 2025-12-25 (Continued)

**Completed: Iteration 4 - Voice Output (100%)**

✅ **Achievements:**
- Integrated ElevenLabs TTS for voice output
- Implemented sentence-level streaming for low latency
- Built parallel TTS generation (up to 2 concurrent requests)
- Created order-preserving audio playback system
- Fixed audio scrambling with Map-based ordering
- Cleaned up dead code (removed test files)

📚 **Learning Topics:**
- ElevenLabs API and ReadableStream handling
- Sentence extraction with regex
- Parallel vs sequential processing trade-offs
- Race condition handling in async operations
- Audio playback with HTML5 Audio API
- Blob/ObjectURL memory management
- Rate limiting (ElevenLabs: 2 concurrent max)

🎯 **What Works:**
- Aloy speaks responses with natural voice
- Parallel TTS generation (low latency)
- Sequential playback (correct order)
- Text and audio appear simultaneously
- Order preserved even when TTS completes out of sequence

🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
```
Streaming text → Extract sentences → Parallel TTS (max 2) →
Store in Map with order index → Play in sequence
```

**Key Innovation:**
- Order tracking with `Map<orderIndex, audioBuffer>`
- `nextOrderIndex++` when queuing
- `nextPlayIndex++` when playing
- Handles race conditions where fast sentences finish before slow ones

**Next Session:** Iteration 5 - Voice Input (STT with Deepgram)

---

### Session 5 - 2025-12-25 (Continued)

**Completed: Iteration 5 - Voice Input (100%)**

✅ **Achievements:**
- Integrated Deepgram STT for speech-to-text
- Implemented spacebar push-to-talk
- Real-time transcription (interim results show as you speak)
- Web Audio API microphone capture
- PCM16 audio format conversion
- Hybrid mode (text + voice both work)
- Fixed Bluetooth compatibility (uses native sample rate)

📚 **Learning Topics:**
- Deepgram Live Transcription API
- Web Audio API (AudioContext, MediaStreamSource, ScriptProcessorNode)
- getUserMedia() for microphone access
- Float32 → PCM16 audio conversion
- Sample rate handling (48kHz native vs 16kHz optimal)
- Bluetooth audio device limitations
- WebSocket bidirectional streaming

🎯 **What Works:**
- Hold spacebar → Record voice → Release → Aloy responds
- See words appear in input field as you speak
- Same Claude flow as text input
- Full voice conversation loop working

🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
```
Mic → MediaStreamSource → ScriptProcessorNode →
Float32 audio → Convert to PCM16 → Send to Deepgram →
Receive transcript → Send to Claude → TTS → Audio response
```

**Key Learnings:**
- Bluetooth devices (AirPods) need native sample rate
- ScriptProcessorNode deprecated but simpler than AudioWorklet
- Must connect processor to destination for callbacks to fire
- `isRecording` flag prevents audio leak after release

**Challenges Solved:**
1. **Bluetooth AirPods silent audio:** Fixed by using native sample rate instead of forcing 16kHz
2. **Audio continues after release:** Added `isRecording` flag for immediate stop
3. **Empty transcripts:** Sample rate mismatch - changed to 48kHz

**Status:** ✅ **Full voice conversation working!**

## Next Session Planning - 2025-12-25

**Discussion Topic:** Making voice chat more interactive

**Decision:** Implement Iteration 6 - Interruption + Latency Optimization

### Interruption Design Discussion

**Question posed:** When user interrupts Aloy mid-sentence, what happens?

**Options considered:**

**Option A: Discard & Fresh Response** ⭐ CHOSEN
- Stop Aloy immediately
- Clear all queues and state
- User speaks new question
- Aloy generates fresh response to new question
- Original response discarded completely

**Option B: Queue & Resume** ❌ Rejected
- Save interrupted response state
- Handle new question
- Resume original response afterward
- Too complex, awkward UX

**Option C: Smart Context Switch** ❌ Rejected
- AI determines if interruption is related
- Integrate or discard based on context
- Very complex, adds latency

**Rationale for Option A:**
- Natural conversation flow (humans don't "resume" after interruption)
- Simple implementation (~15 lines)
- No queue management complexity
- User interrupts BECAUSE they want to change direction
- Clean state reset

### Implementation Plan

**Part 1: Interruption**
- Create `stopAloyCompletely()` function
- Modify spacebar keydown to allow interruption during 'speaking' state
- Clear all queues: sentenceQueue, audioBuffers, currentAudio
- Reset indices: nextOrderIndex, nextPlayIndex
- Start fresh recording

**Part 2: Latency Optimization**
- Reduce stopRecording() wait: 500ms → 200ms
- Parallelize Claude start with Deepgram finalization
- Profile timing to measure improvements
- Target: <3s total response time (from ~5.3s)

**Edge Cases:**
- Rapid interruptions (last one wins)
- Interrupt during thinking (allow)
- Interrupt during first sentence (same behavior)

**Files to update:**
- `src/renderer/app.js` - Main implementation
- Documentation updated (ROADMAP.md, NEXT_SESSION.md)

**Status:** Ready to implement in next session

See `NEXT_SESSION.md` for detailed implementation plan.
