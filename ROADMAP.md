# Aloy Voice Agent - Build Roadmap

## Project Overview

Building a voice AI advisor named **Aloy** (from Horizon Zero Dawn) to help brainstorm ideas, choose topics, and strategize for the GreatInventions media project.

**Primary Goal:** Learn to build prototypes quickly through hands-on development.

## Agent Specifications

### Personality - "Aloy"
- **Role:** Brainstorming partner for GreatInventions
- **Tone:** Energetic, conversational, fast-paced
- **Response style:** Brief (2-3 sentences max), asks follow-up questions (max 1-2), offers crisp actionable suggestions
- **Voice:** Female voice matching Aloy's character (strong, curious, determined)
- **Knowledge base:** Full GreatInventions context

### Interaction Model
- **Input:** Press and hold spacebar to speak
- **State flow:** Automatic transitions based on agent state
  - User presses space → **Green** (Listening)
  - User releases space → **Purple** (Thinking)
  - Agent starts speaking → **Orange** (Speaking)
  - Agent finishes → **Blue** (Idle)

### Visual Design
Inspired by J&J screenshots - Siri-like spirit orb interface:
- **Spirit orb:** Radial gradient, soft blur, animated
- **State indicator:** Pill-shaped tag below showing current state
- **Color-coded states:**
  - Blue: Idle/waiting
  - Green: Listening
  - Purple: Thinking/processing
  - Orange/yellow: Speaking

### Memory System
- After each conversation, Aloy generates a summary
- Saves to `conversations/memory.json` with:
  - Date/time
  - Topics discussed
  - Ideas generated
  - Decisions made
  - Action items
  - User's interests/priorities
- On startup, loads last 10 conversation summaries
- Provides continuity across sessions

### Context Sources
Aloy has full knowledge of GreatInventions:
- `/Users/sash/Documents/GreatInventions/PROJECT_GOALS.md`
- `/Users/sash/Documents/GreatInventions/GreatInventions.md`
- Published articles:
  - WiFi (Hedy Lamarr + CSIRO)
  - Shipping Container (Malcolm McLean)
  - QR Code
- Writing style, target audience, growth strategy

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Desktop App:** Electron + Node.js
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or React TBD)
- **STT:** Deepgram (~$0.0043/min)
- **LLM:** Claude API (Sonnet 4.5) with streaming
- **TTS:** ElevenLabs (~$0.30/1K chars) with streaming
- **Audio:** Web Audio API

### Latency Target
<2 seconds from user finishing speech to Aloy starting to speak

### Optimization Strategy
1. Stream everywhere (Deepgram, Claude, ElevenLabs)
2. Sentence-level chunking (send to TTS immediately)
3. Parallel processing (generate next sentence while speaking current)
4. Efficient audio buffering

### Budget Constraint
<$10 total for all testing/iteration (~6 hours of conversation time)

## Feature Roadmap

### Iteration 1: Static UI + State Management
**Goal:** Visual design working perfectly, state transitions smooth and automatic

**Tasks:**
- Set up Electron app boilerplate
- Build spirit orb visual (CSS/Canvas radial gradient)
- Implement 4 color states (blue/green/purple/orange)
- Create pill-shaped state tag
- Add smooth color transitions
- Implement spacebar detection
- Wire up automatic state flow:
  - Spacebar press → Green
  - Spacebar release → Purple
  - Simulate "agent speaking" → Orange
  - Return to Blue after timeout
- Add animations (pulse for listening, rotation for thinking, waveform for speaking)

**Success Criteria:**
- Press spacebar → see green (listening)
- Release → purple (thinking)
- Automatic transition → orange (speaking)
- Smooth animations throughout
- Returns to blue idle state

**What You'll Learn:**
- Electron app structure
- CSS animations and gradients
- Keyboard event handling
- State management in UI

- On app startup, load last 10 summaries
- Include summaries in system prompt as context
- Test continuity (reference previous conversation topics)

**Success Criteria:**
- Have a conversation about "next article topic"
- Close and reopen app
- Start new conversation - Aloy references previous discussion
- Memory file is human-readable and accurate

**What You'll Learn:**
- File I/O in Node.js
- Conversation summarization techniques
- Context management strategies

- Select female voice matching Aloy's character
- Integrate TTS into conversation flow
- Stream audio chunks and play immediately
- Sync UI to speaking state (orange when audio playing)
- Handle audio playback errors gracefully
- Test voice quality and adjust settings

**Success Criteria:**
